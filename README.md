# Syntra Dashboard: From Views to Revenue

![Syntra Dashboard Landing Page](dashboard/public/dashboard-header.png)

## Stop Guessing. Start Growing.

You spend hours creating YouTube videos, pouring your expertise into content for your coaching business. But let's be honest, you're asking the big questions:

*   "Are my videos *actually* making me money?"
*   "Which content brings in high-ticket clients"
*   "Where are people dropping off in my funnel?"

Answering these feels like guesswork. You're stuck digging through separate analytics on YouTube, your calendar, and your payment processor, trying to connect the dots.

**Syntra is the bridge between your content and your cash flow.** It's a dashboard that connects the dots for you, giving you a single, clear view of your entire high-ticket funnel.

## Key Features âœ¨

*   ðŸ“Š **See Your Entire Funnel:** From YouTube views to website visitors, booked calls, and closed deals, you get a complete picture of your customer's journey. No more switching between ten different tabs.

*   ðŸŽ¥ **Pinpoint Your Best Content:** Discover exactly which videos are your money-makers. Syntra attributes every sale back to the specific YouTube video that brought them in, so you can double down on what works.

*   ðŸ“ˆ **Track Real Growth:** Watch your business evolve with simple, beautiful charts. See month-over-month trends for revenue, calls, and conversion rates to make data-driven decisions, not gut-feel guesses.

## Data Flow & Live Demo Mode

This dashboard is designed to provide a comprehensive, real-time view of your business funnel by integrating data from multiple sources.

### Data Sources
The application connects to the following services to pull live data:

1.  **YouTube Analytics API:** To get video views, subscriber counts, and other channel performance metrics.
2.  **Cal.com API:** To track booked calls, qualified leads, and show-up rates. Video attribution is handled by passing a `video` parameter in the Cal.com booking link.
3.  **Kajabi API:** To pull revenue data, including sales, payment plans, and product breakdowns.

### How It Works

The data flows from these external APIs into the Next.js backend, where it is processed, combined, and then served to the frontend components. This allows for a unified view of the entire customer journey, from initial view to final sale.

### Current Status: Live Demo Mode

**Currently, the dashboard is in "Live Demo Mode".** All data is being generated by mock scripts located in the `/dashboard/mockData` directory. This provides a realistic and fully functional demonstration of the dashboard's capabilities without requiring live API keys. The mock data simulates the entire funnel, including video performance, call bookings, and revenue.
