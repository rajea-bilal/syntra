# Funnel Analytics Dashboard

This dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of a high-ticket coaching business's sales funnel, with a primary focus on tracking performance from YouTube video views to final sales. It's designed to help identify top-performing content, analyze conversion rates at each stage of the funnel, and make data-driven decisions to optimize marketing efforts.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Funnel Overview**: A top-level view of the entire sales funnel, from YouTube views to revenue.
- **Video Performance Analysis**: Detailed attribution to track which YouTube videos are generating leads, calls, and sales.
- **Monthly Trend Analysis**: Track key metrics over time to understand growth and identify patterns.
- **Revenue Deep Dive**: Break down revenue by source, product, and payment type.
- **Glassmorphism UI**: A modern, clean, and aesthetically pleasing user interface.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

### Current State: Mock Data

The application is currently running in a **demo mode** using mock data. This allows for UI development, component testing, and showcasing functionality without requiring live API credentials.

- **Mock API**: The data is served from local API endpoints located in `/app/api/mock/`.
- **Data Generation**: On-the-fly mock data is generated by scripts in the `/mockData/` directory. These scripts simulate realistic data for:
    - Monthly calls and website visitors (`/api/mock/cal/monthly-calls`)
    - Monthly revenue and sales data (`/api/aip/mock/kajabi/monthly-revenue`)
    - YouTube video analytics (`/api/youtube/analytics`)

This setup ensures that the application is fully functional for demonstration purposes.

### Future State: Live Data Integration

The primary goal is to connect the dashboard to live data sources to provide real-time analytics. This will involve integrating with the following services:

1.  **Google/YouTube API**: To fetch real channel statistics, video performance metrics, and view counts.
2.  **Cal.com (or other scheduling tool)**: To pull data on booked calls, accepted calls, and show-up rates.
3.  **Kajabi (or other payment/course platform)**: To get accurate data on sales, revenue, and product performance.

## üîß Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18.x or later)
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd dashboard
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Set up environment variables:**
    Create a `.env.local` file in the `dashboard` directory and add the following variables.

4.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Environment Variables

To connect to the Google API for future live data integration, you will need the following credentials from the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).

```
# Google / YouTube API Credentials
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_google_client_id
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_google_client_secret

# NextAuth Configuration
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=a_random_string_for_session_encryption
```

- `NEXTAUTH_URL`: Should be set to your application's public URL. For local development, it's `http://localhost:3000`.
- `NEXTAUTH_SECRET`: A secret key used to encrypt session data. You can generate one using `openssl rand -base64 32`.

## ÈÉ®ÁΩ≤ (Deployment)

The application is configured for easy deployment on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).

1.  Push your code to a GitHub repository.
2.  Connect your repository to Vercel.
3.  Set the **Root Directory** to `dashboard` in the Vercel project settings.
4.  Add the environment variables listed above to your Vercel project.
5.  Deploy!
